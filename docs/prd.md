# Web Responsiveness Testing MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Provide essential responsive testing capabilities covering 10-15 most common devices rather than comprehensive enterprise device libraries
- Enable professional client deliverables and team collaboration workflows for responsive design validation
- Build using proven technologies with simplified architecture achievable by mid-level developers in 3-4 months

### Background Context

The web responsiveness testing market presents a significant gap for small development teams, freelancers, and growing agencies. Enterprise solutions like BrowserStack provide 3,000+ devices at $32,433/year average cost—far more than most projects need—while simple free tools like Responsively App lack professional features for client work and team collaboration. Small dev teams spend 20-30% of project time on manual responsive testing, freelancers struggle to provide professional testing deliverables to clients, and remote teams lack collaborative testing workflows.

Our Web Responsiveness Testing MVP addresses this by providing core professional functionality with a focused device testing approach (8-12 most popular devices covering 95% of real-world usage), team-friendly workflows designed for client work, and modern collaboration features including screenshot sharing, project organization, and client-friendly reporting—all built on a proven technical stack familiar to mid-level developers.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Clean, professional interface that prioritizes speed and efficiency for development teams. The design should feel familiar to developers while remaining accessible to designers and project managers. Focus on reducing cognitive load during testing workflows with clear visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and minimal steps to complete core tasks. The interface should convey professionalism suitable for client presentations while maintaining the simplicity needed for rapid iteration during development cycles.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **URL-first workflow**: Primary entry point is URL input with immediate preview and testing capabilities
- **Synchronized multi-device interaction**: All device views respond to navigation, scrolling, and form interactions simultaneously
- **One-click screenshot capture**: Instant screenshot generation across all active device views with immediate download/sharing options
- **Contextual actions**: Screenshot, sharing, and export functions appear contextually when hovering or selecting device views

### Core Screens and Views

- **URL Input & Device Selection Screen**: Landing page with URL input, device configuration selection, and quick-start options
- **Multi-Device Testing Dashboard**: Primary working view displaying synchronized website renders across selected devices, with a way to download a professional report
- **Screenshot Gallery & Management**: Organized view of captured screenshots with annotation, comparison, and sharing capabilities
- **Project History**: Saved URLs, test configurations, and historical test results organized by project or client
- **Settings & Configuration**: Account preferences, custom viewport definitions, and team collaboration settings

### Branding

Clean, modern interface with developer-focused aesthetic. Primary color palette should convey professionalism and reliability suitable for client presentations. Typography should prioritize readability and code-friendly fonts for URL/technical displays. Minimal visual elements that don't interfere with website content being tested.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Web-responsive application optimized for desktop and tablet usage, with mobile accessibility for quick reviews and sharing. Primary usage expected on desktop/laptop screens 1280px+ width, with tablet support for collaborative review sessions.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing both frontend and backend services with clear separation between components. This approach simplifies initial development, dependency management, and deployment while allowing future extraction of microservices as the system scales.

### Service Architecture

**Monolithic prototype with microservices progression**: Start with monolithic Spring Boot application containing all core functionality, then incrementally extract services (screenshot processing, user management, project data) as user load and feature complexity increase. This approach balances development speed with future scalability needs.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration testing**: Comprehensive unit test coverage for business logic components, integration tests for API endpoints and database operations, basic end-to-end testing for critical user workflows. Manual testing convenience methods for screenshot validation and cross-browser compatibility verification.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and developer productivity
- **UI Component Library**: Material-UI (MUI) for consistent design system and rapid prototyping
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, predictable state management
- **Backend Framework**: Java with Spring Boot for rapid API development and mature ecosystem
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright for reliable cross-browser screenshot generation and website interaction
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for complex relational data (user accounts, project configurations, test history)
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for session management, screenshot caching, and async job queues
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development environments and simplified deployment
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS or similar with auto-scaling capabilities to handle concurrent user loads
- **Message Queues**: Redis-based queuing for asynchronous screenshot processing with CompletableFuture and @Async annotations
